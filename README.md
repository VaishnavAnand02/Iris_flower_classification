# Iris Flower Classification Project

This is a simple machine learning project that uses the classic Iris dataset to classify flower species based on sepal and petal measurements using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.


## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Libraries Used

- Python 3.11
- Pandas ‚Äì for data manipulation
- NumPy ‚Äì for numerical operations
- Scikit-learn ‚Äì for model training and evaluation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn ‚Äì for visualization

## üìä Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the well-known Iris flower dataset, which contains 150 samples of Iris flowers, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The target variable includes three species:
- Iris-setosa
- Iris-versicolor
- Iris-virginica

## üß™ Model Overview

A K-Nearest Neighbors classifier was trained after standardizing the input features. The model achieved an accuracy of approximately **97.78%** on the test set.

### Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report (precision, recall, F1-score per class)

## üìà Visualizations

Two key visualizations were generated:
- **Pairplot**: Shows feature relationships across different species.
- **Confusion Matrix Heatmap**: Visual representation of model performance.

## üöÄ Future Improvements

Potential enhancements include:
- Trying other classification algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, SVM)
- Performing hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- Implementing cross-validation
- Building a simple GUI or web app using Streamlit or Tkinter
